                                The League held its first council meeting in Paris on 16 January 1920, six days after the Treaty of Versailles and the Covenant of the League of Nations 
                                came into force. On 1 November 1920, the headquarters of the League was moved from London to Geneva, where the first General Assembly was held on 15 
                                November 1920.

                                the first session of the Assembly. This represented a large portion of existing states and corresponded to more than 70% of the world's population.

                                The Vilna Crisis was a dispute between Poland and Lithuania over the city of Vilnius, the League tried to intervene and even created a 
                                commission to help them sort they're problem out. These help were ignored and the issue remained unresolved as Poland captured Vilna, at least
                                until the Soviet occupation of the Baltic States during WWI and Vilnius became part of Lithuania and nowadays its capital city. The dispute remained
                                for more years, however, and there was nothing the League could do.

                                After WW1, the border between Greece and Albania was redrawn. Enrico Tellini, an Italian general, had the job of patrolling it. In August
                                of 1923, Tellini and a few other Italian soldiers were murdered on the border. This led the current Italian leader, Benito Mussolini, to
                                demand 50 million lira (which would today be around $1,750,000) from Greece as compensation, but Greece refused to pay (and also refused to
                                accept some of Mussolini’s other terms). In response, <a class="source-highlight" href="https://www.historyireland.com/ireland-corfu-crisis-1923/" target="new">Italy invaded and bombarded Corfu</a>, and Greece appealed to the League of Nations for
                                help. Italy would not accept the League’s demand for it to leave Corfu, nor would Britain and France agree on how to take further action
                                against Italy, so the matter would eventually be passed to the Conference of Ambassadors, which would eventually rule that Italy would leave
                                Corfu, but it also stated that Greece would have to pay. Italy, in the end, won.

                                The Ruhr Crisis of 1923 was a pivotal event in post-World War I Europe when France and Belgium, frustrated by 
                                Germany's failure to meet reparations payments, occupied the industrial Ruhr region. Despite the League of Nations' 
                                mission to ensure peace and mediate conflicts, it proved ineffective in preventing or resolving this crisis. The 
                                League's inability to address economic and political grievances, coupled with its failure to provide a viable solution, 
                                underscored its limitations. This event marked a significant blow to the League's credibility, revealing its ineffectiveness 
                                in preventing larger geopolitical conflicts and contributing to the organization's diminishing influence in the years 
                                leading up to World War II.

                                The Dawes Plan, implemented in 1924, was a crucial economic initiative aimed at addressing the reparations issue stemming from World 
                                War I. Named after American financier Charles G. Dawes, the plan sought to reorganize Germany's reparations payments to France and 
                                Belgium, facilitating their receipt and easing Germany's economic burden. The plan indirectly connected to the League of Nations as it 
                                was endorsed by the Allied powers and became a framework for stabilizing European economies. While the Dawes Plan helped temporarily 
                                alleviate economic tensions, its broader impact on European stability was limited, and it did not prevent the economic challenges that 
                                later contributed to the Great Depression. The League of Nations, despite its aspirations for collective security, faced ongoing economic 
                                and political complexities, and the Dawes Plan exemplifies the attempts to manage these challenges outside the League's direct purview.

                                Relations between Greece and Bulgaria had been strained since the early 20th century by their rivalry over the possession 
                                of Macedonia and later Western Thrace, which led to years of guerrilla warfare between various pro-Bulgarian Macedonian 
                                paramilitaries and the pro-Greek HMC in the Macedonian Struggle.

                                Signed in Locarno, Switzerland, in 1925, the Locarno Treaties aimed to stabilize post-World War I Europe by securing territorial
                                boundaries and fostering reconciliation among major powers. The Treaty of Mutual Guarantee, involving Germany, France, Belgium,
                                Italy, and Britain, committed to peaceful dispute resolution and mutual defense. According to Eduqa Scott titled by Tutor2u, “these
                                treaties recognized Germany's western borders and promoted arbitration between Germany and Poland, and Germany and Czechoslovakia.” While
                                initially reducing tensions and fostering stability in the late 1920s, the treaties faced limitations, particularly in addressing broader
                                security concerns and the League of Nations' shortcomings. Ultimately, they failed to prevent the outbreak of World War II amidst rising
                                nationalism and economic challenges.

                                The Manchurian Crisis, also known as the Mukden Incident, unfolded in 1931 when the Japanese Kwantung Army orchestrated a staged explosion near
                                a railway in Manchuria, providing a pretext to invade. The military swiftly took control, establishing the puppet state of Manchukuo. In response,
                                the League of Nations dispatched the Lytton Commission, which found Japan in violation of international law. Despite the report recommending
                                Manchuria's return to China, Japan rejected the League's conclusions and withdrew in 1933. This crisis underscored the League's incapacity to prevent
                                aggression, dealt a blow to its authority, and set a precedent for subsequent acts of aggression. According to Kenneth Pletcher titled by Britannica
                                “The League's failure to curb Japanese aggression revealed its limitations in enforcing collective security, contributing significantly to its decline
                                and the onset of World War II.

                                The Colombian - Peru war of 1932 until the year later 1933 was over the Amazonian town of Leticia. Both countries, Colombia and Peru 
                                brought the argument over to the League of Nations looking for a beneficial solution for both countries. The League provided the “Committee 
                                of Three” which was formed by the USA, Brazil and Chile and the sole purpose was to give a solution and negotiate between the two nations. 
                                That's when the Salomon-Lozano treaty was signed, which stated that Leticia would be part of Colombia and Peru would retire their troops. Peru initially
                                refused to accept, but did in 1934.

                                After the Locarno Pact of 1925, the League of Nations set up a preparatory commission to prepare for a Disarmament Conference to be held
                                in Geneva. During the meetings, the idea of German equality surged, and the German chancellor proposed their rearmament as a solution,
                                and later his death and the surge of the Nazi party only further boosted this idea. When the Conference for the Reduction and Limitation of Armaments actually took
                                place in February of 1932, the question of German equality dominated all others and Germany would be unsatisfied when the conference would
                                be paused in July, so they chose to withdraw from negotiations. Other powerful countries sparked a promise to give Germany equality, and
                                the conference resumed soon after in February of 1933, but, although there were other, more powerful countries against German rearmament,
                                fear and mistrust caused by Adolf Hitler’s rise to power made it harder for the conference to progress, and Italy ended up siding with
                                Germany, creating a pact that would, <a class="source-highlight" href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Italo-Ethiopian-War-1935-1936t" target="new">according to Walter A. McDougall from Encyclopedia Britannica,</a> “grant Germany equality, revise the
                                peace treaties, and establish a four-power directorate to resolve international disputes.” The pact was eventually signed and Germany
                                began arming shortly after, and the conference was soon abandoned in 1934, shutting down further prospects of disarmament.

                                The Chaco War (Spanish: Guerra del Chaco, Guarani: Cháko Ñorairõ) was fought from 1932 to 1935 between Bolivia and Paraguay, over the control of the 
                                northern part of the Gran Chaco region (known in Spanish as Chaco Boreal) of South America, which was thought to be rich in oil.

                                On June 12, 1935, Paraguay and Bolivia signed the Peace Protocol after three years of war over Chaco territory. This historical event that occurred 
                                86 years ago allows us to remember today the nearly 36,000 soldiers who lost their lives defending their country.

                                In the 1930s, the world economic depression encouraged nations to be more aggressive towards each other. Fascist dictatorships took power in Germany, 
                                Italy and Japan, which were intent on empire-building and these countries defied the League.

                                Previously, in the 1980s, Italy had attempted to conquer Abyssinia (now Ethiopia) but failed, and Abyssinia was, in 1934,
                                now one of the only countries left in Africa that wasn’t under European rule. However, a border dispute between Abynissia and
                                Italian Somaliland (an Italian colony in Africa) gave the current Italian dictator, Benito Mussolini, an excuse to get involved.
                                After refusing multiple arbitration (when an entity oversees and regulates a dispute, like how an arbiter regulates a football
                                match) offers, Mussolini decided to invade Abyssinia on October 3, 1935. The Italian invaders pushed back the insufficiently-armed
                                Ethiopian troops and would soon conquer the capital less than half a year later. The League of Nations morally condemned Italy’s
                                actions, but Mussolini ignored it and pushed forward. The League later voted to impose economic sanctions on them, but they were
                                ineffective because the major powers were not interested in opposing Italy. <a class="source-highlight" href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Italo-Ethiopian-War-1935-1936" target="new">According to the Encyclopedia Britannica</a>, the conflict
                                “contributed to international tensions between the fascist states (like Italy) and the Western democracies, and served as a rallying
                                point, especially after World War II, for developing African nationalist movements.” Finally, <a class="source-highlight" href="https://www.johndclare.net/league_of_nations6b.htm" target="new">as said by the historian AP Adamthwaite</a>, "the Abyssinian crisis delivered a death blow to the League."

                                Ever since the Treaty of Versailles was signed, the Rhineland had been taken away from Germany and was demilitarized as stated in the treaty’s
                                terms. After 1933, however, other nations began to worry about their safety with Germany after Adolf Hitler became its chancellor, and he’d frequently
                                voiced that he would stop at nothing to abolish the Treaty of Versailles. In 1935, France signed a treaty of friendship with the USSR, and Germany claimed
                                it was hostile against them and Hitler used this to send German troops into the Rhineland in March 1936, which violated the Treaty of Versailles’
                                and Locarno Treaties’ terms. Even after negotiations, Hitler refused to withdraw his troops and put pressure on the League of Nations to act, and
                                it was unable to. France was in the middle of elections, and, <a class="source-highlight" href="https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/resources/german-occupation/" target="new">as the British National Archives pointed out,</a> "Britain thought that the Treaty was too harsh against Germany, leading them to do nothing."
                                Hitler would eventually move on from the occupation of the Rhineland, soon seizing other territories until he reached Poland in September 1939.

            <h3>How impactful or successful were the League’s attempts at peacekeeping in the 1920s/1930s?</h3>

                From my research, I was able to conclude that the League of Nations had its fair share of failures. It was severely underequipped, had next
                to no power, and was just a weak and badly-designed organization in general. The events that I researched; the Corfu incident, the Abyssinia Crisis,
                the Geneva Conference, and the Remilitarization of the Rhinelands; were all massive failures for the League, and they left a permanent negative effect on
                the world. Its lack of control and power led to there being many disputes where the League was unable to do anything, leading me to believe that it wasn't
                too successful at peacekeeping. It did have its few victories, like in Mosul, but it had many more failures. Its attempts were very impactful, yes, but
                not for the better. The League's objective was to prevent future wars, and its attempts have proven themselves to be unsuccessful.

            <h3>How important was the League’s humanitarian work?</h3>
            <hr>
            <h4>Samuel Pertuz</h4>
            <p>
                An answer to this question can go both ways. The League of Nations worked tirelessly (to its capacity) to solve different world problems, especially
                humanitarian ones. It had large, special agencies and commissions like the Refugees Committee, the Slavery Commission, and the Health Committee, all
                with humanitarian purposes. According to BBC news, the League "took half a million prisoners of war home, helped Turkish refugees, attacked slave traders and drug sellers, 
                and supported measures against leprosy and malaria", proving that they did make an impact. Their work was important, and saved countless lives and improved
                living conditions for many people around the globe. Imagine the world without vaccines for leprosy and malaria! The issue isn't that they didn't help; the issue is that the League was not capable of reaching its humanitarian goals
                as they were simply too ambitious. Helping half a million prisoners and tons of Turkish refugees is already a difficult task, but completely eradicating slavery and helping
                all refugees would simply be impossible. The League's humanitarian efforts were substantial, but it had no chance of reaching its original goals.
